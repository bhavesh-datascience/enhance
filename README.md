# 🖼️ Enhance – Image Upscaling and Quality Restoration Tool

**Enhance** is a powerful Python-based tool designed to **enhance image quality** and **upscale low-resolution images** using AI. Built for developers, content creators, and researchers, this project leverages deep learning models for super-resolution and facial detail restoration.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Super-resolution image upscaling (2x, 4x)
- 🎯 Face restoration using GFPGAN
- 🧠 Real-ESRGAN for general image enhancement
- 📁 Batch processing for folders
- 💾 High-quality output with no visual artifacts

---

## 🛠️ Models Used

- 🤖 **GFPGAN** – Face enhancement and restoration
- 🧬 **Real-ESRGAN** – General super-resolution model
- Optionally supports DFDNet, CodeFormer with modification

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhavesh-datascience/enhance.git
cd enhance
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Models will auto-download on first use, or you can manually place them in the specified model folders.

---

## 📸 Usage

Basic single-image enhancement:

```bash
python enhance.py --input input.jpg --output output/ --upscale 4 --face-enhance
```

### Parameters:

| Argument         | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `--input`        | Path to input image                  |
| `--output`       | Directory to save enhanced image     |
| `--upscale`      | Upscale factor (`2`, `4`)            |
| `--face-enhance` | Apply face restoration using GFPGAN  |
| `--model`        | Choose model: `realesrgan`, `gfpgan` |
| `--input_dir`    | Batch input folder                   |
| `--output_dir`   | Output folder for batch mode         |

---

## 🔧 Example

Enhance and upscale a folder of images:

```bash
python enhance.py --input_dir samples/ --output_dir results/ --upscale 2 --face-enhance
```

---



---

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

Enhance combines the power of:

* **Real-ESRGAN** for high-quality super-resolution
* **GFPGAN** for accurate facial detail recovery
* Supports running on both CPU and GPU (GPU recommended)
